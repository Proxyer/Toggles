    <content>- &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;The 'Notify Me Later' Update!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; Right-click an alert on the screen to put it to sleep. Set number of sleep hours in the mod settings. If the alert is still relevant after that time, it'll reappear.

- (Probably) Fixed bug where Toggles messed up some textures on other mods.
