## Use Cases
Not sure what to use this mod for? There is plenty! Here are a few examples:
* You're tough as hell. You laugh at _Randy Random_, and eat _Toxic Fallout_ for breakfast. Want a challenge? Make the game harder by removing positive events, like _Psychotic Soothe_, _Aurora_ and _Resource Pod Crash_. See [Incidents](https://github.com/krafs/Toggles/wiki/Incidents)
* You prefer a more laid back, less intimidating RimWorld experience. _Infestations_ and _Alphabeavers_ don't fit your idea of a good time. Well, block them from happening completely, and play RimWorld the way **you** want. See [Incidents](https://github.com/krafs/Toggles/wiki/Incidents)
* Constantly looking to the right of the screen at the slightest **Ping**, only to discover it's only a notification about some colonist being idle? Tired of being told your paste dispenser doesn't have a hopper? Well, block them and feel the psychic soothe of silence! See [Alerts](https://github.com/krafs/Toggles/wiki/Alerts)
* Your stay in RimWorld is a busy one. There is always something going on, and your right side of the screen is always filled to the brim with the needs of your colonists. Don't you wish there was a simple way to quickly clean out some of the less crucial alerts, without disabling them in the settings? Put the alerts to sleep! Set the sleep timer in the settings, and right-click them on the screen! See [Alerts](https://github.com/krafs/Toggles/wiki/Alerts)
* You are all about immersion. If there was a way to actually **be** in RimWorld, you would. However, until some one makes a mod for Oculus Rift, or Elon Musk makes affordable, commercially available space travel, _Toggles_ will have to do. Toggle your HUD on or off with a hotkey! It's almost like being there. Almost. See [Toggleable HUD](https://github.com/krafs/Toggles/wiki/Use-Case-Example-:-Toggleable-HUD)
