# Toggles

This is a mod for RimWorld, allowing for toggling various graphical elements and gameplay mechanics.

Makes it possible to hide and suppress various events and graphical elements:
    <br/>- Incidents
    <br/>- Alerts
    <br/>- Letters
    <br/>- Buttons
    <br/>- Links
    <br/>- Etc

<br/>Ok, so there aren't toggles for everything, but "some things" doesn't sound as good :)

<br/>Toxic Fallout bumming you out? Game too easy with all the wanderers joining the colony? Or maybe you're just tired of constantly getting notified about it? Or how about those menu buttons: do you really need the Tutorial anymore? And how often do you watch the Credits? Do you wish you could hide those and just see what you actually use?
<br/>This mod allows you to do that. Everything is done through the mod settings. Just toggle the settings you want, and be on your way. 

<br/><b>About Events</b>
<br/>This mod contains a settings category called Events. This category features three subcategories:
<br/>- Letters
    <br/>Refers to the notifications appearing in the form of a letter symbol, and are triggered by incidents. These can be toggled by category, or by adding them manually once you've received them at least once in the game.
    <br/>- Alerts
    <br/>Similar to letters, but appear in the form of simple text notes.
<br/>- Incidents
    <br/>Actual game condition changes, like Ambrosia sprouts and Diseases. Toggling these completely blocks them from happening.

<br/><b>Why?</b>
<br/>I am a Java developer, but this project is my first dive into C#, not to mention Harmony, RimWorld, and game modding overall. I was inspired by mods like ED-Enhanced Options and No Tutorial Button, and wanted to try it out myself. It just grew from there, and this is the result. However, I plan to add more toggles for RimWorld, and maybe integrate other mods if there is demand for it.

<br/><b>Dependencies</b>
<br/>- HugsLib

<br/><b>Compatibility</b>
<br/>-Developed and tested mainly for vanilla RimWorld, but should work with anything that doesn't completely alter the code base.
<br/>-Should be completely safe to add and remove from save games. (But always backup before adding any new mods to your load order).
